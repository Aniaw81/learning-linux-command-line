## Following along with the course

I recommend using a Linux PC to follow this course. If you are not able to use a Linux PC, there are some options to consider:

- Use GitHub Codespaces
	- Fork this repository to create a copy of it in your own GitHub account
	- From your fork, click the Code button and choose Start Codespace
	- Commit your modified files to your own fork of the repository in order to save changes
- Set up a virtual machine on your PC using software like VirtualBox
	- See [Learning VirtualBox](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-virtualbox-19862434) for more details
- Use Windows Subsystem for Linux on a Windows 10 or 11 system
	- See [Learning Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-windows-subsystem-for-linux-16134127) for more details

**Note:** macOS is not Linux. macOS uses Zsh by default, not Bash, and it has a different set of core utilities. Some items shown in the course will differ or will not work if you're following along using macOS. 

**Note:** Some Linux distributions, like Alpine Linux, use a different shell and include different core utilities.
